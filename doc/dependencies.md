Controlling dependencies
------------------------
Some dependencies are not needed in all configurations. The following are some factors that affect the dependency list.

#### Options passed to `./configure`
* MiniUPnPc is not needed with `--without-miniupnpc`.
* libnatpmp is not needed with `--without-natpmp`.
* Berkeley DB is not needed with `--disable-wallet` or `--without-bdb`.
* SQLite is not needed with `--disable-wallet` or `--without-sqlite`.
* Qt is not needed with `--without-gui`.
* If the qrencode dependency is absent, QR support won't be added. To force an error when that happens, pass `--with-qrencode`.
* If the systemtap dependency is absent, USDT support won't compiled in.
* ZeroMQ is needed only with the `--with-zmq` option.

#### Other
* Not-Qt-bundled zlib is required to build the [DMG tool](../contrib/macdeploy/README.md#deterministic-macos-dmg-notes) from the libdmg-hfsplus project.
